# Account Features Implementation

## Overview

The account functionality has been enhanced with several key features to provide a complete user experience. All features are accessible from the main account dashboard.

## Implemented Features

### 1. Account Dashboard
- Main account overview page with user information
- Quick access to all account features
- Logout functionality

### 2. Order History
- **Page**: `/account/orders`
- View past orders with details
- See order status, dates, and totals
- Itemized breakdown of each order

### 3. Wishlist
- **Page**: `/account/wishlist`
- Save favorite products for later
- Add/remove items from wishlist
- Persistent storage using localStorage
- Wishlist context for global access

### 4. Account Settings
- **Page**: `/account/settings`
- Update personal information (name, email)
- Change password functionality
- Form validation for security

## Technical Implementation

### Context Providers
1. **WishlistContext** - Manages wishlist state across the application
   - `addToWishlist()` - Add product to wishlist
   - `removeFromWishlist()` - Remove product from wishlist
   - `isInWishlist()` - Check if product is in wishlist

2. **CartContext** - Already implemented for shopping cart functionality

### API Endpoints
1. **Wishlist API** - `/api/wishlist`
   - GET - Retrieve user's wishlist
   - POST - Add item to wishlist
   - DELETE - Remove item from wishlist

### UI Components
1. **ProductCard** - Enhanced with wishlist toggle button
2. **Product Detail Page** - Added wishlist functionality
3. **Account Dashboard** - Central hub for all account features

## User Flow

1. User logs in through `/login` or registers through `/register`
2. Upon successful authentication, user is redirected to `/account`
3. From the account dashboard, user can access:
   - Order History (`/account/orders`)
   - Wishlist (`/account/wishlist`)
   - Account Settings (`/account/settings`)
4. User can logout from any account page

## Data Persistence

- **Wishlist**: Stored in localStorage for persistence between sessions
- **Account Settings**: Updated in localStorage (in a production app, this would be stored in the database)
- **Order History**: Sample data for demonstration (in a production app, this would be fetched from the database)

## Security Notes

- Passwords are stored in plain text in this demo (not suitable for production)
- In a real application, passwords should be hashed and salted
- Authentication tokens (JWT) should be used for secure sessions
- User data should be validated and sanitized on both client and server
